# sublime-compile-assembly
Sublime build module to compile the current iOS C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++/Swift source file to assembly

## Testing

The easiest way to test updates to this module is to uninstall the production
package from Github, and instead symlink the git directory into
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`; changes will be picked
up automatically by Sublime.
